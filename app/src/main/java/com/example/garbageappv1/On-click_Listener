An on-click listener is an interface in the View class, which respond when the user types or clicks on thethe is is  is button or clickable object in User Interface.
It works somehow like the Scanner in Java, I would say, but the main difference is that this is an active function, is “listening” or
in other words waiting for the user input. There must be coordination between input and output, so the term concurrency is very much relevant
while talking about listeners.

My on click-listener describes what the where_button does and how the edit text in the layout must respond when the input is done, based on the matcher method
which compares the input text with database items and respond accordingly to the request - if item is the the same answer nr1, if item different - answer nr2.
